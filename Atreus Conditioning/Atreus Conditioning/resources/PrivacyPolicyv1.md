# What personal data is collected

The Atreus Conditioning application will collect a user's email address and training data.

Training data is any data input by the user which describes a sporting exercise the user is doing, has done, or will do. 
A non-exhaustive list of examples of such training data is:
 - The names of exercises
 - The date and time of exercises 
 - Written notes from the user
 - The type of exercises (weightlifting, running, rowing, etc.)
 - The duration of exercises
 - Specific metrics associated with each exercise: the number of repitions, the percieved exertion, resistance/weight


# Why personal data is collected and processed

Personal data are collected for the fundamental operation of core app functionality. The lawful basis for collecting these personal data is
Article 6 (1)(b) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The collection and processing of personal data within the Atreus app, which may be considered 'health data' is permitted by Article 9 (2)(a) 
of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Email addresses are collected such that user accounts can be established and managed by the user. User accounts are necessary 
such that personal data can be assigned to a user account and be accessed solely by that user account. 

Training data is necessary as the core functionality of the app is to collect training data and process the collected data.


# Where personal data is stored and processed

Data is stored remotely using the Google Firebase service and is retained for as long as the user maintains an account, 
unless deletion is requested. Firebase data is stored securely on Google Cloud servers, located with in European Union (EU).

For UK users, this involves a transfer of data outside the UK. The transfer is lawful under UK GDPR, and Google provides 
adequate safeguards to protect your personal data. For EU users, personal data remains within the EU.

Google may process data on its behalf, but only within the EU. For more information about Firebase’s data processing and 
security measures, see Firebase Data Processing Terms and Google Privacy Policy.


# Who has access to the personal data

The data controller for the purposes of GDPR is Jay Norton.

Access to personal data is limited to Jay Norton who manages and maintains the app. Personal data is only shared with Google (Firebase) as part of app functionality.

# How long personal data is retained for

Personal data is retained in Firebase until a deletion request is submitted by the user. Similarly, any data stored directly on the local device may also be deleted 
by submitting a deletion request.

The user may request for their own personal data to be deleted either within the app using the "Delete account" button, or by using the contact details below
