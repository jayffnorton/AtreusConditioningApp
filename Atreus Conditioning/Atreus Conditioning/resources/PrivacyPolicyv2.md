# Atreus Privacy Policy

Effective date: 25 January 2026

By creating an account and using the Atreus app, you agree to the Terms of Service which form the contract between you and Jay Norton, the provider of Atreus. By using the app, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of tracking and managing your training data as described in this Privacy Policy.

# 1. Introduction

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or factors specific to the person’s physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

- Processing means any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, whether or not automated, including collection, recording, organization, storage, retrieval, use, disclosure, alignment, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

- Profiling means automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects, such as health, fitness, performance, or behavior.

- User means any natural person who uses the Atreus app.

# 2. What personal data is collected

Atreus collects the following personal data:

- Email address – used to create and manage user accounts.
- Training data – any data input by the user about their sporting exercises, including (but not limited to): names of exercises, dates and times of exercises, notes from the user, exercise type (weightlifting, running, rowing, etc.), duration of exercises and metrics such as repetitions, perceived exertion, and resistance/weight.

Some processing of your training data may constitute automated evaluation (“profiling”) of certain personal aspects, such as your fitness performance or health-related metrics. This processing is carried out solely to provide you with insights into your training and progress and does not represent a decision the user is subjected to. Article 22 (1).

# 3. Why personal data is collected and processed

Personal data is collected and processed for the core functionality of the Atreus app. The lawful bases are:

Article 6(1)(a) GDPR - processing that the user has consented to (Terms of Service)
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR – processing necessary for the performance of a contract (Terms of Service) with the user.
Article 9(2)(a) GDPR – explicit consent for processing health- or fitness-related training data.

Email addresses are collected to create and manage user accounts.

Training data is collected to provide the app’s training tracking functionality and progress insights.

# 4. Where personal data is stored and processed

Personal data is stored on Google Firebase servers located within the European Union (EU) and retained for as long as the user maintains an account unless deletion is requested.
UK users: storing data on EU servers involves a transfer outside the UK. This transfer is lawful under UK GDPR, and Google provides adequate safeguards to protect your personal data.
EU users: personal data remains within the EU.
Google may process data on our behalf, but only within the EU.
For more information about Firebase’s processing and security measures, see:
Firebase Data Processing Terms
Google Privacy Policy
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

# 5. Who has access to personal data

Data controller: Jay Norton
Access is limited to Jay Norton, who manages and maintains the app.
Personal data is shared with Google (Firebase) only as required to provide the app’s functionality.

# 6. How long personal data is retained

Data is retained as long as the user maintains an account, unless deletion is requested.
Users can delete their account and all associated data at any time using the “Delete Account” feature in the app or by contacting Jay Norton.

Other processing, such as account management and core app functionality, is necessary to provide the service under the Terms of Service. This data cannot be “withdrawn” in the GDPR sense, but you may request deletion of your account at any time.
