# What personal data is collected

The Atreus Conditioning application will collect a user's email address and training data.

Training data is any data input by the user which describes a sporting exercise the user is doing, has done, or will do. 
An exhaustive list of examples of such training data is:
 *The names of exercises
 *The date and time of exercises 
 *Written notes from the user
 *The type of exercises (weightlifting, running, rowing, etc.)
 *The duration of exercises
 *Specific metrics associated with each exercise: the number of repitions, the percieved exertion, resistance/weight

# Why personal data is collected

Email addresses and training data are collected for the fundamental operation of core app functionality.

Email addresses are collected such that user accounts can be established and managed by the user. User accounts are necessary 
such that personal data can be assigned to a user account and be accessed solely by that user account. 

Training data is necessary as the core functionality of the app is to collect training data and process the collected data.

# Where personal data is stored and processed
