specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

- ‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal

# What personal data are collected

The Atreus Conditioning application will collect a user's email address and training data.

Atreus collects the following personal data:

- Email address – used to create and manage user accounts.
- Training data – any data input by the user about their sporting exercises, including (but not limited to): names of exercises, dates and times of exercises, notes from the user, exercise type (weightlifting, running, rowing, etc.), duration of exercises and metrics such as repetitions, perceived exertion, and resistance/weight.


# Why personal data are collected and processed

Personal data are collected and processed for core app functionality of the Atreus app. The lawful bases for collecting these data are:
- Article 6(1)(a) GDPR - processing that the user has consented to (Terms of Service)
- Article 6(1)(b) GDPR – processing necessary for the performance of a contract (Terms of Service) with the user.
- Article 9(2)(a) GDPR – explicit consent for processing health- or fitness-related training data.

Email addresses are collected such that user accounts can be established and managed by the user. User accounts are necessary such that personal data can be assigned to a user account and be accessed solely by that user account. 

Training data is necessary as the core functionality of the app is to collect training data and process the collected data.

# Where personal data are stored and processed

Data are stored remotely using the Google Firebase service and is retained for as long as the user maintains an account, unless deletion is requested. Firebase data are stored securely on Google Cloud servers, located with in European Union (EU).

For UK users, this involves a transfer of data outside the UK. The transfer is lawful under UK GDPR, and Google provides adequate safeguards to protect your personal data. For EU users, personal data remains within the EU.

Google may process data on its behalf, but only within the EU. For more information about Firebase’s data processing and security measures, see Firebase Data Processing Terms and Google Privacy Policy.

Personal data are only shared with Google (Firebase) as part of app functionality.
