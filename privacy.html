<h1>Atreus Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 25 January 2026</p>

<p>
By creating an account and using the Atreus app, you agree to these Terms of Service.
These terms form the contract between you and Jay Norton, the provider of Atreus.
By using the app, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose
of tracking and managing the data, as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>“personal data”</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
        natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
        directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
        identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific
        to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
        natural person;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“processing”</strong> means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal
        data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,
        recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
        consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
        alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“profiling”</strong> means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the
        use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in
        particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at
        work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour,
        location or movements;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“User”</strong> means any natural person who uses the Atreus app.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What personal data are collected</h2>

<p>
The Atreus Conditioning application will collect a user’s email address and training data.
</p>

<p>Atreus collects the following personal data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Email address</strong> – used to create and manage user accounts.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Training data</strong> – any data input by the user about their sporting exercises,
        including (but not limited to): names of exercises, dates and times of exercises, notes from
        the user, exercise type (weightlifting, running, rowing, etc.), duration of exercises and
        metrics such as repetitions, perceived exertion, and resistance or weight.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why personal data are collected and processed</h2>

<p>
Personal data are collected and processed for the core functionality of the Atreus app.
The lawful bases for collecting these data are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Article 6(1)(a) GDPR – processing that the user has consented to (Terms of Service)</li>
    <li>Article 6(1)(b) GDPR – processing necessary for the performance of a contract (Terms of Service)</li>
    <li>Article 9(2)(a) GDPR – explicit consent for processing health- or fitness-related training data</li>
</ul>

<p>
Email addresses are collected so that user accounts can be established and managed.
User accounts are necessary to ensure that personal data are assigned to a specific user
account and are accessible only to that user.
</p>

<p>
Training data are necessary as the core functionality of the app is to collect and process
training data.
</p>

<h2>Where personal data are stored and processed</h2>

<p>
Data are stored remotely using the Google Firebase service and are retained for as long as
the user maintains an account, unless deletion is requested.
Firebase data are stored securely on Google Cloud servers located within the European Union (EU).
</p>

<p>
For UK users, this involves a transfer of data outside the UK. This transfer is lawful under
UK GDPR, and Google provides appropriate safeguards to protect personal data.
For EU users, personal data remain within the EU.
</p>

<p>
Google may process data on its behalf, but only within the EU. For more information about
Firebase’s data processing and security measures, see Firebase’s Data Processing Terms and
the Google Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Who has access to the personal data</h2>

<p>
The data controller for the purposes of GDPR is Jay Norton.
</p>

<p>
Access to personal data is limited to Jay Norton, who manages and maintains the app.
</p>

<p>
Personal data are only shared with Google (Firebase) as part of app functionality.
</p>

<h2>How long personal data are retained</h2>

<p>
Data are retained for as long as the user maintains an account, unless deletion is requested.
</p>

<p>
Users can delete their account and all associated data at any time using the “Delete Account”
feature in the app or by contacting Jay Norton.
</p>

<h2>How you can exercise your rights</h2>

<h3>Right to lodge a complaint</h3>

<p>
If you believe that your personal data have been processed in a way that violates GDPR,
you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
</p>

<p>
For users in the United Kingdom, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Website: <a href="https://ico.org.uk">https://ico.org.uk</a></li>
    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:casework@ico.org.uk">casework@ico.org.uk</a></li>
    <li>Phone: 0303 123 1113</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may contact the ICO directly, or you may contact Jay Norton first if you wish to attempt
to resolve the issue before filing a complaint.
</p>

<h3>Right to access</h3>

All personal data can be accessed using the export feature in the app. Alternatively, a request

<h3>Right to rectification</h3>

<p>

</p>

<h3>Right to erasure</h3>

</p>

<h3>Right to portability</h3>

<p>
Data can be ported using the export feature in the app. Alternatively, a request can be made
using the contact details below.
</p>

<h3>Right to withdraw consent</h3>

<p>
Some processing of personal data is based on explicit consent (for example, processing of
health- or fitness-related training data). Consent can be withdrawn at any time within the app.
Withdrawing consent will stop future processing of this data.
</p>

<p>
Other processing, such as account management and core app functionality, is necessary for
the performance of the contract (Terms of Service). This processing cannot be withdrawn in
the GDPR sense, but users may request deletion of their account and all associated personal
data at any time.
